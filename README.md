 Title: "Global climate change and sigmodontine rodents in the Atlantic Forest" /
 2023-2025 /
 Understanding how current climate change will affect species distributions helps comprehending the processes governing the biotas’ evolutionary history. It is also essential to conservation planning – particularly in biodiversity hotspots like the Atlantic Forest (AF), where climate change alters the extent of suitable habitats for many species. Small mammals, such as rodents, play crucial roles in ecosystems, including predation and dispersal of plant species and their potential loss can have cascading effects. My study aims to assess the potential distributional changes of three Sigmodontinae rodent species endemic to Brazilian AF under distinct future climate scenarios using species distribution modeling. For this, I chose three widely distributed AF species: _Akodon cursor_, _Nectomys squamipes_, and _Rhipidomys mastacalis_.
